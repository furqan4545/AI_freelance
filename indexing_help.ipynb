    "## Docstrings and comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you are writing code, it is good practice to document what you are doing in as clear and readable way as possible. Inline comments e.g. ```# This code splits the data into a training and a test set``` should help clarify what the code itself is doing, particularly if the code might be difficult to understand. Comments are also important to document what you intend the code to do - even if the code doesn't actually work as you'd hoped (this also helps with coursework, because we can award marks for the idea, irrespective of whether the code actually implements that idea). For some hints on good commenting style, have a look here: https://stackabuse.com/commenting-python-code/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important source of documentation is to docstring your functions. Docstrings allow us to quickly understand both what a function does, and how it might be used. They typically include information on input arguments and what the function returns. An example is shown below. For reference on how to do docstrings, have a look here: https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html. (Typically, you can see a function's docstring in Jupyter by selecting an instantiated function name and pressing SHIFT+TAB twice - try this on your own functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in Jupyter Notebooks like this, you can document your code using Jupyter Markup. You might want to use Markup to introduce certain sections of code in more depth than might be covered within the docstring. Or just use it to break the code into more readable sections. In the coursework, we ask that you use the Markup to give your written answers to the questions. \n",
